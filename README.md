In this exercise, you will use the following criteria to determine a tree cutting priority for town of Fire 
Creek. A tree cutting priority is used to determine which dead trees should be cut down first. This 
information will be used to efficiently assign the limited tree removal resources. 
 <br> You will determine the 
tree cutting priority base on the following five factors: 
 <br>
* Tree mortality
* community features
* egress routes
* populated areas
* and electric utilities. <br> 

You will combine all the factors to determine the overall tree cutting priority for fire creek.  <br>
A cutting grid  feature has been created for the town of Fire creek. The final output of this exercise will be a GRID 
divided into zones based on the cutting feature class. Each zone will have a tree cutting priority value.  <br>
Following the spatial analysis framework used in the first project in order to undertake the spatial 
analysis.
